# Third_Task_AI_Music_Generation
"This repository contains my CodeAlpha Internship Task 3: Music Generation with AI. The project demonstrates how to generate simple music sequences using Python and save them as MIDI files. Libraries like music21 are used to create and process notes. The generated output is a .mid file which can be played using any MIDI player or VLC Media Player."
